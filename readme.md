Here is a gulp workflow starter (without theme files) but it is a build environment, similar to the gist I posted. You can download/clone this and it will do the same thing. 

Use the  gulp.config.js file to edit directory paths etc, set a store name etc.
You will need to add your API information in the .shopifysync.json file.

Run gulp and after you've ran yarn and you're good to go.

I just quickly extracted this from an older project, but hopefully if give you some insight on how you can achieve a better build env then Slate, which is faster and compiles far better scripts etc. The bundle directory contains all js that make it possible.

Everything will compile into a theme directory.  You can use the gulp commands for exports etc
